### Tests
The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run and show the test results of all the games on GitLab, but if you would like to run locally you can do that as well. To do so follow these steps: <br>
Make sure pytest and pytest-cov are installed <br>
Open up a terminal and navigate to the database directory and from there run either startdb.cmd or startdb.sh <br>
Then go into the tests folder and in each of the tests change the following line (around line 23) <br>
change: ```python
config['dynamodb'] = {'dynamodb_service_endpoint': 'dynam', 'dynamodb_port': '8000'}``` <br>
to: ```pythong
config['dynamodb'] = {'dynamodb_service_endpoint': 'localhost'', 'dynamodb_port': '8000'}``` <br>
Then in a separate terminal run this command within the final_project folder:
>pytest --cov=pyarcade/Games tests/

# Developer Documentation
> Make sure you have Sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme installed on your computer. <br />
> To access the developer documentation, navigate to final-project/docs and run 'make.bat html' on windows and 'make html' on linux. <br />
> This will generate a build directory inside the docs directory. <br />
> Open up the html directory inside build and find index.html. <br />
> Open up index.html in your browser and this will take you to the developer documentation home page, <br />
> From there you can navigate to the documentation for individual modules. <br />
